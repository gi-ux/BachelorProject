# Bachelor Project

This project was carried out as a diploma project for SUPSI.

It involves studying of the peculiar behaviors of harmful entities in the COVID 19 debate to provide social change towards a better understanding (literacy) of social networks. 

## Tasks

- Identification of tools used for news propagation
- Identification and classification of entities in the discussion
- Behavioral analysis of malicious entities and comparison with competent entities

## Objectives

The main objective of this thesis is to come to distinguish the strategies and impact of correct and malicious entities/actions in the COVID19 debate.
To then identify through which means and behaviors the various malicious entities influence the discussions by analyzing hashtags, shared links, and activities, making a comparison between those whose goal is to inform correctly and those who intentionally spread untrue information.

## Technologies

- Python (wide use of Notebooks)
- Complex networks

## Project structure

To have a better management of the project, different folders have been created:
- notebook folder contains all Notebooks and .py files
- doc folder contains information regarding the progress and implementation of the project, this folder also houses reports for the project display.
- csv folder contains miscellaneous .csv files used
Some folders are kept offline for size and privacy reasons.

### Privacy

Since the data in question is public information on an open platform that can be viewed even without registering with Twitter, there are no privacy-related issues in sharing it. However, the information that was considered confidential was kept offline.

### Data Collection

Data are collected through an existing repository (https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs) on which a hydration process has been done.

### External Tools

#### MediaBias Fact Check ####
For the study of veracity of a shared domain a factchecking tool was used that allows to give a "credibility" score.
Through this score it was possible to obtain a list of domains with high credibility and others with low credibility, distinguishing authoritative and non-authoritative sources.
